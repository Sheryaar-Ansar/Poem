            <p>I see a wishing star up in the sky,
                I start to make a wish upon that wishing star,
                Which was so beauitful in my eyes,
                but by the time Iâ€™d finished the wish,
                The wishing star was starting to move away in the sky,
                So I dipped my eyes & turned away,
                For someone else to have a wish,
                On that wishing star. </p>
