            <p>Hurt and pain.
                There's much to gain.
                Peace and love.
                It's all the same.
                Confusion and doubt.
                We're not without.
                We weep, we cry.
                We plead, we try.
                We laugh, we smile.
                Only to be hurt
                By one last trial.
                Life is a lesson,
                So learn it well.
                Maybe one day
                You can tell its tale.</p>
